 # Nemo Added Techs
 tech_xeno_logistics:0 "Xeno-Logistics"
 tech_xeno_logistics_desc:0 "The art of stellar warfare is an ever evolving field, and we have had opportunities to practice and evolve how we conduct war upon the surface of alien worlds. Now we can consolidate our strategy and ensure our planetary forces are equipped to the best of our ability at all times."
 tech_cloaking_1:0 "Xeno-Camouflage"
 tech_cloaking_1_desc:0 "Active Camouflage and Low Visibility technology have long been available, but standardised methods that worked on our homeworld are useless across the near infinite environments that make up foreign worlds. By devoting resources to engineering specialists who can travel with the army, we can ensure appropriate camouflage methods are ready before our troops even make planetfall."
 tech_cloaking_2:0 "Microprojector Cloaking"
 tech_cloaking_2_desc:0 "Whilst prohibitively expensive, microprojector technology is the closest we have to complete invisibility in a military environment. By adapting the technology ready for practical use, we can create a new generation of shock troops."
 army_attachment_xeno_camouflage_brigade:0 "Xeno Camouflage Corps"
 army_attachment_xeno_camouflage_brigade_desc:0 "Adapting to local environments is a nightmare of logistics for an armed force expected to see service anywhere from a desert moon to a lush jungle to the cargo bay of a starship. This army has it's own Corps of engineers and scientists who specialise in adapting modern military camouflage methods to Xeno environments."
 army_attachment_cloaked_IFV_brigade:0 "Cloaked Division"
 army_attachment_cloaked_IFV_brigade_desc:0 "A specialist division equipped with microprojector technology and emission lowering materials, and supported by similarly hidden support units. The advantages and uses for 90% cloaked commando squads are beyond counting."
 tech_telomere_replication:0 "Telomere Replication"
 tech_telomere_replication_desc:0 "By delving into the depths of our own DNA coding, we determined that Telomeres are one of the hidden triggers for the end of a natural lifespan. Now, we master the art of reinforcing these delicate strange of information so that we can further delay death."
